    "\n",
    "- You are welcome to discuss the problems with your classmates but __you are not allowed to copy any part of your answers from your classmates.  Short code snippets are allowed from the internet.  Code from the class text books or class provided code can be copied in its entirety.__\n",
    "- There could be tests in some cells (i.e., `assert` and `np.testing.` statements). These tests (if present) are used to grade your answers. **However, the professor and FAs could use __additional__ test for your answer. Think about cases where your code should run even if it passess all the tests you see.**\n",
    "- Before submitting your work, remember to check for run time errors with the following procedure:\n",
    "`Kernel`$\\rightarrow$`Restart and Run All`.  All runtime errors will result in a minimum penalty of half off.\n",
    "- Data Bricks is the official class runtime environment so you should test your code on Data Bricks before submission.  If there is a runtime problem in the grading environment, we will try your code on Data Bricks before making a final grading decision.\n",
    "- All plots shall include a title, and axis labels.  Unless stated otherwise, plots can be made using your favorite Python plotting package.\n",
    "- Grading feedback cells are there for graders to provide feedback to students.  Don't change or remove grading feedback cells.\n",
    "- Don't add or remove files from your git repo.\n",
    "- Do not change file names in your repo.  This also means don't change the title of the ipython notebook.\n",
    "- You are free to add additional code cells around the cells marked `your code here`.\n",
    "- Students may use toPandas() to print the head of data frames.\n",
    "- We reserve the right to take points off for operations that are extremely inefficient.  This is a big data class and extremely inefficient operations make a big difference when scaling up to large data sets.\n",
    "- Students are responsible for reading the usage comments and understanding how to properly use the utility functions (like get_training_filename()) provided in the assignments.  Runtime errors which result from incorrect usage of utility functions shall result in a  point reduction.  \n",
    "- import * is not allowed because it is considered a very bad coding practice and in some cases can result in a significant delay (which slows down the grading process) in loading imports.  For example, the statement `from sympy import *` is not allowed.  You must import the specific packages that you need.\n",
    "- If you perform databricks specific operations, you MUST protect those operations in an if statement by calling the is_databricks() function provided in all homework assignments.  For example, if you use dbutils (databricks utilities), only run dbutils commands if is_databricks() returns true.  Runtime errors created in the grading environment by not protecting databricks specific commands in an if statement will result in a runtime error points deduction. \n",
    "- The graders reserve the right to deduct points for subjective things we see with your code.  For example, if we ask you to create a pandas data frame to display values from an investigation and you hard code the values, we will take points off for that.  This is only one of many different things we could find in reviewing your code.  In general, write your code like you are submitting it for a code peer review in industry.  \n",
    "- Level of effort is part of our subjective grading.  Oftentimes there is a large disparity between the level of effort between students who are trying learn, and students who are trying to do the minimum possible to check off an assignment requirement.  For example, in cases where we ask for a more open ended investigation, some students put in significant effort and some students do the minimum possible to meet requirements.  In these cases, we may take points off for students who did not put in much effort as compared to students who did put in a lot of effort.  We feel that the students who did a better job deserve a better grade.  We reserve the right to invoke level of effort grading at any time.\n",
    "- __Only use spark, spark machine learning, spark data frames, RDD's, and map reduce to solve all problems unless instructed otherwise.  Heavy weight operations that convert data to pandas or spark (like collect()) will result in a point reduction.__"
